A Lifestyle of Class & Luxury

Louis Quatorze was founded in 1980 by Paul Barrate, a Versailles leather craftsman who was inspired by the distinct artistic style of the 17th-century French nobles, particularly the Sun King, Louis XIV. Seeking to reinterpret this ancient style in a modern way, Paul decided to create a brand that offered a new trademark of luxury, one that is derived from exceptional quality and expert artistry.
In perfect harmony with the everlasting style of tradition and art, Louis Quatorze combines modernity with an elegance that is characteristic of French nobility. The brandâ€™s designs are ever dynamic and transcend seasons and generations.

- Heritage

The age of Louis XIV bears inspiration

LOUIS QUATORZE refers to the Sun King, Louis XIV of France. What was it like in the days of Louis XIV? Louis XIV was a politician and man with a refined taste and eye for beauty. The 17th century France, during his reign, is marked by its height of all areas of art and culture. it was when the Chateau of Versailles was built, haute couture was in vogue and diamond was first referred to as the crown jewel. The advent of 'elegantly refined', 'sophisticated', 'intellectual' style as we know of and associate with France in the present day can be traced back to this era.
LOUIS QUATORZE embodies the incorporation of the two; contemporary sensibility and the beauty flourished during this period in history when Louis XIV was in reign, to whom history owes its brilliant cultural heritage, and incorporation by which LOUIS QUATORZE achieves to present cultural value beyond its matter.
